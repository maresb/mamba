# Mamba Repodata Record Metadata Issue Fix

## Problem Description

When installing packages from explicit lockfiles using mamba/micromamba, the generated `repodata_record.json` files contain incomplete metadata. Specifically:

1. **`depends` field is empty** - This is problematic for conda-lock and other tools that rely on dependency information
2. **`timestamp` field is 0** - Missing actual package timestamp
3. **`sha256` field is missing** - Only `md5` is present

## Root Cause

The issue occurs in the `PackageDownloadExtractTarget::write_repodata_record()` method in `libmamba/src/core/transaction.cpp`. When installing from explicit URLs:

1. A `PackageInfo` object is created with minimal metadata from the URL
2. The package is downloaded and extracted, creating a complete `index.json` with full metadata
3. However, `write_repodata_record()` overwrites the complete metadata from `index.json` with incomplete metadata from the URL-based `PackageInfo`
4. The result is a `repodata_record.json` that's missing critical information like dependencies

## The Fix

The fix modifies the `write_repodata_record()` method to intelligently merge metadata:

- **Preserve critical fields** from the extracted package (`index.json`): `depends`, `constrains`, `license`, `license_family`, `track_features`
- **Update validation fields** from URL metadata: `md5`, `sha256`
- **Conditionally update** other fields from URL metadata only if they're missing or invalid in the extracted package

## Files Modified

1. **`libmamba/src/core/transaction.cpp`** - Fixed the `write_repodata_record()` method
2. **`libmamba/tests/test_repodata_record.cpp`** - Added comprehensive tests
3. **`libmamba/tests/CMakeLists.txt`** - Added the new test file

## Testing

### Running the Tests

```bash
cd libmamba
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make test_repodata_record
./test_repodata_record
```

### Reproducing the Issue

Use the provided `reproduce_issue.sh` script to reproduce the issue:

```bash
./reproduce_issue.sh
```

This script:
1. Creates a test lockfile with an explicit URL
2. Installs the package using micromamba
3. Checks the generated `repodata_record.json` for the issue
4. Reports whether the issue is confirmed

### Expected Behavior

**Before the fix:**
- `depends` field is empty array `[]`
- `timestamp` field is `0`
- `sha256` field is missing

**After the fix:**
- `depends` field contains the actual package dependencies
- `timestamp` field contains the actual package timestamp
- `sha256` field is present (if available in the package)

## Impact

This fix ensures that:
- **conda-lock** can properly read dependency information from cached packages
- Package metadata integrity is maintained
- Tools relying on `repodata_record.json` get complete information

## Backward Compatibility

The fix is backward compatible:
- Existing behavior for regular package installations is unchanged
- Only explicit URL installations are affected
- The fix improves metadata quality without breaking existing functionality

## Verification

To verify the fix works:

1. Apply the patch
2. Build mamba/micromamba
3. Run the test suite
4. Use the reproducer script to confirm the issue is resolved
5. Check that `repodata_record.json` now contains complete metadata

## Related Issues

This fix addresses the core issue described in the problem statement where conda-lock cannot read cached metadata because the `depends` field is empty. The fix ensures that the cached metadata contains all the information that conda-lock expects to find.
